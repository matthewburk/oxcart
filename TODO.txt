- Each oxcart_text instance currently encapsulates a single vertex buffer which
  itself is used to store data for a single string.  Having numerous vertex
  buffers is not recommended, so re-using a single oxcart_text instance for
  different strings is currently required.  This is inefficient and requires a
  lot of back and forth to the gpu.  This form of oxcart_text should be used for
  dynamic text (e.g. fps counter which changes every frame).  A new variant
  should be made that has a single vertex buffer, but stores multiple strings in
  it, each possibly being referenced using glDrawElementsBaseVertex().  This
  form should be used for static text.  Each string will have a max length limit
  (i.e. size of buffer divided by number of possible entries).
